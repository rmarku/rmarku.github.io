I try to be constantly updated with the latest advances the field. I am a responsible and self-motivated person, passionate for everything I do. Having studied Computer Engineering, I am interested in hardware and software development, from microcontrollers and IOT to FrontEnd technologies, like React and Vue.\nI also enjoy building and using software that makes life simpler and easier. I consider performance and good use of hardware resources very important, thats why I like C and C++ programming languages. I love teaching about software and hardware design, good practices and patterns."},"skills":[{"type":"Languages","list":[{"level":100,"name":"C"},{"level":90,"name":"C++"},{"level":90,"name":"Javascript"},{"level":80,"name":"HTML/CSS/SASS"},{"level":80,"name":"Shell Scripting"},{"level":50,"name":"Python"},{"level":50,"name":"PHP"},{"level":30,"name":"Java"}]},{"type":"Technologies/Tools","list":[{"level":90,"name":"NodeJS"},{"level":70,"name":"Docker"},{"level":75,"name":"React"},{"level":100,"name":"Microcontrollers"},{"level":90,"name":"Git"},{"level":90,"name":"Embeded Software"},{"level":80,"name":"IOT"},{"level":60,"name":"CI"},{"level":40,"name":"GraphQL"}]},{"type":"Data Bases","list":[{"level":60,"name":"MySQL"},{"level":60,"name":"SQL"},{"level":30,"name":"MongoDB"}]},{"type":"Operating Systems","list":[{"level":100,"name":"Linux"},{"level":90,"name":"Windows"},{"level":100,"name":"FreeRTOS"}]},{"type":"Others","list":[{"level":100,"name":"Team Work"},{"level":90,"name":"Agile"},{"level":70,"name":"DevOps"},{"level":70,"name":"Testing"}]}],"languages":[{"fluency":"Native speaker","language":"Spanish"},{"fluency":"Advanced","language":"English"}],"journals":[{"ISSN":"2451-7631","authors":"Marcucci Martin, Aliciardi Agustina Edmé, Collino Fabricio, De Cunto Guillermo, Bosio, M.
