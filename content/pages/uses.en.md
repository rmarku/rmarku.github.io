Set of software and hardware tools that I frequently Use .

### Software

🐧 Since I was 15, I use **Linux** as my operating System. I started with Conectiva Linux, then Mandrake, later on Slackware, Debian and finally settle on Gentoo for a long time. Since March of 2020 I'm on **Arch Linux**.

📝 For *JavaScript* and *web development* in general, I use [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the OSS Version. It's configured with [**Atom One Dark Theme**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=akamud.vscode-theme-onedark)

📝 For *C++*, I use [**CLion**](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/clion/) from JetBrains, It's a great and complete IDE. I'm trying to change it by Visual Studio Code, but I miss a lot of functionality from CLion.

As Termina, I use **Yakuake** with **ZSH** shell with **PowerLevel9**

My preferred browser is **Firefox** since a long time.
