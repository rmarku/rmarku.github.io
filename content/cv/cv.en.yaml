summary: |-
  I am passionate about technology and learning about it. I try to
  be constantly updated with the latest advances the field.
  I am a responsible and self-motivated person, passionate for everything I do.
  Having studied Computer Engineering, I am interested in hardware and software development,
  from microcontrollers and IOT to FrontEnd technologies, like React and Vue.

  I also enjoy building and using software that makes life simpler and easier. I consider
  performance and good use of hardware resources very important, thats why
  I like C and C++ programming languages.
  I love teaching about software and hardware design, good practices and patterns.
