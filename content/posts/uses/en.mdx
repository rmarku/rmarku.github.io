Set of software and hardware tools that I frequently Use.

## Software

üêß I have been a **Linux** user since I was 15 years old. My first experience was with **Connective Linux**,
followed by **Mandrake**, then **Slackware** and **Debian**. Eventually, I settled on **Gentoo**, which I stuck with for a long time.
However, one day my PC broke down, and out of the urgency to get it up and running, I decided to try **Arch**.
I found this distribution excellent, and I used it for 2 years. However, as time went by,
I felt the call to go back to **Gentoo**, which is the operating system I use nowadays.

üìù For _JavaScript_ and _web development_ in general,
I use [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
the OSS Version. It's configured with
[**Atom One Dark Theme**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=akamud.vscode-theme-onedark)

üìù For _C++_, I use [**CLion**](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/clion/)
from JetBrains, It's a great and complete IDE. I'm trying to change it by
Visual Studio Code, but I miss a lot of functionality from CLion.

As Termina, I use **Kitty** with **ZSH** shell with **PowerLevel9**

My preferred browser is **Firefox** for a long time.
