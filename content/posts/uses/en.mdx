Set of software and hardware tools that I frequently Use.

## Software

🐧 Since I was 15, I use **Linux** as my operating System.
I started with Conectiva Linux, then Mandrake, and later on Slackware,
Debian, Arch Linux and finally settle on Gentoo after a long time.

📝 For _JavaScript_ and _web development_ in general,
I use [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
the OSS Version. It's configured with
[**Atom One Dark Theme**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=akamud.vscode-theme-onedark)

📝 For _C++_, I use [**CLion**](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/clion/)
from JetBrains, It's a great and complete IDE. I'm trying to change it by
Visual Studio Code, but I miss a lot of functionality from CLion.

As Termina, I use **Kitty** with **ZSH** shell with **PowerLevel9**

My preferred browser is **Firefox** for a long time.
