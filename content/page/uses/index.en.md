Set of software and hardware tools that I frequently Use.

## Software

üêß I have been a **[Linux]** user since I was 15 years old. My first experience was with **[Conectiva Linux]**,
followed by **[Mandrake]**, then **[Slackware]** and **[Debian]**. Eventually, I settled on **[Gentoo]**, which I stuck with for a long time.
However, one day my PC broke down, and out of the urgency to get it up and running, I decided to try **[Arch]**.
I found this distribution excellent, and I used it for 2 years. However, as time went by,
I felt the call to go back to **[Gentoo]**, which is the operating system I use nowadays.

üìù For _JavaScript_ and _web development_ in general,
I use [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
the OSS Version. It's configured with
[**Atom One Dark Theme**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=akamud.vscode-theme-onedark)

üìù For _C++_, I use [**CLion**](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/clion/)
from JetBrains, It's a great and complete IDE. I'm trying to change it by
Visual Studio Code, but I miss a lot of functionality from CLion.

As Termina, I use **Kitty** with **ZSH** shell with **PowerLevel9**

My preferred browser is **Firefox** for a long time.

## Hardware

üíª **[MSI GS66 12UGS]** i9-12900H 32Gb RTX3070 Ti

üñ±Ô∏è **[Logitech MX Anywhere 2/2S]** Very good mouse with Bluetooth and SimpleLink up to 3 devices.

‚å®Ô∏è **[Corne Keyboard]** Split Keyboard that helps to keep your hands more comfortable, it
is more ergonomic and smaller. I can put [QMK] and customize several things on the keyboard.
Now, no turning back.

üñ•Ô∏è **[LG 23EA53]** Vertical Monitor 23" FullHD
üñ•Ô∏è **[HP E273q]** HorizontalMonitor 27" QHD
üñ•Ô∏è **[Asus MB16AC]** Portable Monitor 15.6" FullHD

üì± **[Motorola Edge 30 pro]**

üéß **[Sony WH-1000xm4]** best ever.

üéß **[Skullcandy Crusher]** best Bass ever.
